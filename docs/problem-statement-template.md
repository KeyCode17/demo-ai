# Problem Statement Template

This template provides a standardized format for documenting problems and their solutions across the repository. Use this structure to ensure consistency and completeness in problem statements.

## 1. Problem Description

**Purpose**: Provide a detailed explanation of the issue, including why it's a problem.

### Guidelines:
- Clearly define what the problem is
- Explain the current state vs. desired state
- Describe the impact of not solving this problem
- Include relevant context and background information
- Specify who is affected by this problem
- Reference any supporting data, metrics, or evidence

### Template:
```
**Current Situation**: [Describe the current state or behavior]

**Problem Impact**: [Explain how this problem affects users, business, or systems]

**Root Cause**: [If known, describe what is causing the problem]

**Affected Stakeholders**: [List who is impacted by this problem]

**Supporting Evidence**: [Include relevant data, user feedback, or metrics]
```

## 2. Solution Provided

**Purpose**: Document the proposed solution to address the problem.

### Guidelines:
- Describe the solution approach clearly and concisely
- Explain how the solution addresses the root cause
- Include technical implementation details where relevant
- Specify any assumptions or dependencies
- Outline the scope of the solution (what's included and excluded)
- Mention alternative solutions considered and why they were not chosen

### Template:
```
**Proposed Solution**: [High-level description of the solution]

**Implementation Approach**: [Technical details of how the solution will be implemented]

**Key Features**: 
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]

**Dependencies**: [List any prerequisites or dependencies]

**Assumptions**: [Document any assumptions being made]

**Out of Scope**: [Clearly state what is not included in this solution]

**Alternatives Considered**: [Brief description of other options evaluated]
```

## 3. Integration & Business Impact

**Purpose**: Document how the solution integrates with existing systems and the business value it delivers.

### Guidelines:
- Explain how the solution fits into the current architecture
- Identify integration points with existing systems
- Quantify the business value and benefits
- Specify success metrics and KPIs
- Address potential risks and mitigation strategies
- Include timeline and resource requirements

### Template:
```
**System Integration**:
- [Integration point 1]: [Description]
- [Integration point 2]: [Description]
- [Integration point 3]: [Description]

**Business Value**:
- **Cost Savings**: [Quantify cost reductions if applicable]
- **Efficiency Gains**: [Describe process improvements]
- **User Experience**: [Explain UX improvements]
- **Revenue Impact**: [Detail revenue implications if applicable]

**Success Metrics**:
- [Metric 1]: [Target value]
- [Metric 2]: [Target value]
- [Metric 3]: [Target value]

**Risk Assessment**:
- **High Risk**: [Description and mitigation]
- **Medium Risk**: [Description and mitigation]
- **Low Risk**: [Description and mitigation]

**Resource Requirements**:
- **Development Time**: [Estimated effort]
- **Infrastructure**: [Any new infrastructure needed]
- **Personnel**: [Team members or skills required]

**Timeline**: [Project timeline with key milestones]
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Copy this template** when creating a new problem statement document
2. **Replace the bracketed placeholders** with your specific content
3. **Remove unused sections** if they don't apply to your problem
4. **Add additional sections** if needed for your specific use case
5. **Review and validate** that all sections are complete before finalizing

## Example File Naming Convention

Use the following naming pattern for problem statement documents:
- `problem-statement-[feature-name].md`
- `problem-statement-[issue-id].md`
- `problem-statement-[brief-description].md`

Examples:
- `problem-statement-user-authentication.md`
- `problem-statement-issue-123.md`
- `problem-statement-performance-optimization.md`
